<p> During this past summer I engaged a Community Research Fellowship sponsored by the University Honors College and additionally led a presentation with my fellow undergraduate cohorts. We provided a pecha kucha style presentation that highlighted our research that focused on various aspects related to public transportation, water sustainability, and co-curricular youth programming. My project specifically explored how black students can utilize social media in order to influence their community’s narrative.</p>

<p> In response to recent protests surrounding the unlawful killings of Black people by the police and
white vigilantes, many folks have looked to education as a response to racism. Institutions of Higher
Learning offer a unique space to engage timely, impactful material that can shape and reimagine the
world as we know it and futures unseen. Though many strive to believe that we have transcended
beyond race, it is resoundingly clear the role that race play in the identity, classification, and context
of millions of Americans around our nation today. The purpose of this directed study, then, is to
investigate race’s evolution within rhetorical and legal understandings, and to interrogate how those
constructions shape contemporary society.</p>

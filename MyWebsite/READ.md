For my project I've chosen to create a personal website. The website's main focus is writing and reading. It includes recommendation for reading as well as music playlists
it also includes and About me page, a contact page, and a some of my own personal work 

*Contact Page: My Linkedin suppose to show up the form of a badge that is located in the center of the page but sometimes it shows up up as a hyperlink. I'm not quite sure
how to fix that. 
* Homepage: Large amount of space underneath recent activies section might add another element to fill up space

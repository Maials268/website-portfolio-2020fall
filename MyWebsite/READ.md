For my project I've chosen to create a personal website/portfolio. This website is center aruond my writing experiences. I wanted to created something thats is a mixture between between professional and casual . Therefore, I have included elements that could be considered both. For instance, on the homepage of chosen to include an embedded spotify playlists specifically for writing along with a book recommendation. Moreover, on the right I've chosen to inluded recent activities I participated in such as a conference I took part in over the summer as well as an independent study that I am currently in. I then have have an About Me page that is presented in a fashion similar to a very short cover letter. I additonally have a contact page where I have emdedded a link to my linked in. Lastly, I have created a page that is meant to showcase of the writing pieces I have taken part in. The layout of this page is in three rows. One row for research writing, one row for academic writing and another row for academic writing.

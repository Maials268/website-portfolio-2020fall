The Wave: Should you fear it or fear being left out of it
I wrote this piece for an English Composition course. I was tasked with researching the origins, history and cultural meanings of one word in English and then I had to create a story about it that tracks the word’s lexical change and explains the cultural significance of those changes.</p>

No You Cannot Touch It
I wrote this piece for an English Composition course. The assignment was to write an experimental translingual/code-meshing text. I chose to write in African American Vernacular English and Standard English. I strategically placed the different dialects in order to achieve a particular rhetorical effect upon my readers.</p>

    <p>Black Female Perspective of “Diversity” Programs: Considerations of Hospitality on a College Campus
This presentation explores the concept of hospitality via “inclusion” programs in relation to reported experiences of black women on predominately white college campuses. According to Khalilah Annette Shabazz (2015), targeted academic advising, mentoring, availability of a staff or faculty member, can all be considered part of institutional support programs related to inclusion. Through interviewing Black women in college-prep programs such as RISE and BRIDGES, I sought to understand how these programs work to support community-building for these women in particular.University of Pittsburgh

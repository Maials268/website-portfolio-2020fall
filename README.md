For my project I've chosen to create a personal website. The website's main focus is writing and reading. It includes recommendations for reading as well as a music playlist. It also includes an About me page, a contact page, and some of my own personal work

*Contact Page: My Linkedin suppose to show up the form of a badge that is located in the center of the page but sometimes it shows up up as a hyperlink. I'm not quite sure how to fix that.

Homepage: Large amount of space underneath recent activies section, might add another element to fill up space.

Website is fully responsive

All of my main file are located inside the folder titled "MyWebsite" 

Index.html is my website's homepage and all other pages can be access from it once opened in search engine.

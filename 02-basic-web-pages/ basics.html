    <h1> Internet is Easy!</h1>
    <p> First, we need to learn some basic HTML. </p>
     <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site.</p>
  </body>
</html>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>This how you make an unordered list</p>

<ul>
  <li> Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
  <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
  <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>

<ol>
  <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
  <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
  <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
  <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
      an ordered list</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Inline elements</h2>
      <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase</p>
      <p>Other times Other times you need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize he importance
of a word or phrase.</p>
  <p><em><strong> And sometimes you need to strongly shout</strong></em></p>
